### Coordination Layers

#### 1. Strategic Layer (Orchestration Master)
- **Responsibility**: High-level workflow planning and agent selection
- **Scope**: Cross-project coordination and resource allocation
- **Timeframe**: Long-term (hours to days)

#### 2. Tactical Layer (Task Coordination)
- **Responsibility**: Task decomposition and dependency management
- **Scope**: Within-project task coordination
- **Timeframe**: Medium-term (minutes to hours)

#### 3. Operational Layer (Agent Execution)
- **Responsibility**: Individual task execution and status reporting
- **Scope**: Single agent operations
- **Timeframe**: Short-term (seconds to minutes)

## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Chain
```yaml
sequential_chain:
  description: "Tasks executed in strict sequence with handoffs"
  use_cases:
    - "Requirements → Architecture → Implementation"
    - "Analysis → Design → Testing"
  
  coordination_flow:
    1. agent_a_completes: "Produces output artifacts"
    2. validation_gate: "Orchestrator validates completion"
    3. context_handoff: "Relevant context passed to next agent"
    4. agent_b_starts: "Next agent begins with validated input"
  
  advantages:
    - "Clear dependencies and handoffs"
    - "Easier to debug and trace"
    - "Predictable resource usage"
  
  disadvantages:
    - "Longer overall execution time"
    - "Blocking on single agent failures"
    - "Underutilized parallel capacity"
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution
```yaml
parallel_execution:
  description: "Independent tasks executed simultaneously"
  use_cases:
    - "Code analysis + Security audit + Performance testing"
    - "Multiple feature implementations"
  
  coordination_flow:
    1. work_decomposition: "Break work into independent streams"
    2. resource_allocation: "Assign resources to each stream"
    3. parallel_launch: "Start all agents simultaneously"
    4. progress_monitoring: "Track all streams independently"
    5. result_consolidation: "Merge results when all complete"
  
  advantages:
    - "Faster overall execution"
    - "Better resource utilization"
    - "Fault isolation between streams"
  
  disadvantages:
    - "Complex coordination requirements"
    - "Potential resource conflicts"
    - "Difficult result consolidation"
```

### Pattern 3: Pipeline Processing
```yaml
pipeline_processing:

    - "Batch processing workflows"
  
  coordination_flow:
    1. stage_definition: "Define pipeline stages and buffers"
    2. continuous_feed: "Feed work items into pipeline"
    3. stage_processing: "Each stage processes and passes forward"
    4. flow_control: "Manage backpressure and throughput"
    5. output_collection: "Collect completed items"
  
  advantages:
    - "Continuous throughput"
    - "Efficient resource utilization"
    - "Scalable processing capacity"
  
  disadvantages:
    - "Complex flow control"
    - "Difficult error handling"
    - "State management complexity"
```

### Pattern 4: Event-Driven Coordination
```yaml
event_driven:
  description: "Agents react to events and state changes"
  use_cases:
    - "Monitoring and alerting workflows"
    - "Reactive system maintenance"
  
  coordination_flow:
    1. event_detection: "Monitor for triggering events"
    2. agent_selection: "Choose appropriate response agents"
    3. context_enrichment: "Add relevant context to event"
    4. agent_activation: "Activate selected agents"
    5. response_coordination: "Coordinate agent responses"
  
  advantages:
    - "Responsive to changing conditions"
    - "Efficient resource usage"
    - "Natural scalability"
  
  disadvantages:
    - "Complex event management"
    - "Difficult to predict behavior"
    - "Potential event storms"
```
