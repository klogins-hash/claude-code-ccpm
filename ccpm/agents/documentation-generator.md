Brief description of the API's purpose and capabilities.

## Authentication
Details about authentication methods and requirements.

## Base URL
```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Endpoints

### GET /resource
Retrieve a list of resources.

**Parameters:**
- `limit` (integer, optional): Maximum number of results (default: 20)
- `offset` (integer, optional): Number of results to skip (default: 0)
- `filter` (string, optional): Filter criteria

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "name": "Resource Name",
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],

  }
}
```

```
```

### Architecture Documentation
```markdown
# System Architecture Documentation

## Overview
High-level description of the system and its purpose.

## Architecture Diagram
```mermaid

    Client[Client Applications] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> API[API Gateway]
    API --> Auth[Authentication Service]
    API --> App[Application Services]
    App --> DB[(Database)]
    App --> Cache[(Redis Cache)]
```

## Components

### API Gateway
- **Purpose**: Request routing and rate limiting
- **Technology**: Kong/Nginx
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Request authentication and authorization
  - Rate limiting and throttling
  - Request/response transformation
  - Monitoring and logging

### Application Services
- **Purpose**: Core business logic implementation
- **Technology**: Node.js/Express
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Business logic processing
  - Data validation and transformation
  - External service integration
  - Event publishing

## Data Flow
1. Client sends request to Load Balancer
2. Load Balancer routes to API Gateway
3. API Gateway authenticates request
4. Request routed to appropriate Application Service
5. Service processes request and returns response

## Security Considerations
- All communication uses TLS 1.3
- JWT tokens for authentication with 15-minute expiry
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests/hour per user
- Input validation on all endpoints

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of application services
- Database read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Redis cluster for distributed caching
- Auto-scaling based on CPU and memory metrics
